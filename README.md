# Magic Tasks

This plugin is inspired by goblin.tools's [Magic ToDo](https://goblin.tools/).

Click on a task in Obsidian, press `Ctrl + M` (or `Command + M` on a Mac) to ask ChatGPT to break down the task into small sub-tasks. You can change the shortcut to something else if you prefer.

You will need an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) for this work. This also means your task will be sent to the OpenAI servers for processing. Read [their privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) to see how they handle your data.
