# Magic Tasks

This plugin is inspired by goblin.tools's [Magic ToDo](https://goblin.tools/).

Click on a task in Obsidian, press `Ctrl + M` (or `Command + M` on a Mac) to ask ChatGPT to break down the task into small sub-tasks. You can change the shortcut to something else if you prefer.

On mobile, tap on the task you want to break down and pull down to open the menu of actions. Search for `Magic Tasks` and you get it from there.

### Disclaimer

You will need an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) for this work. This also means your task will be sent to the OpenAI servers for processing. Read [their privacy policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) to see how they handle your data.

There's also a cost associated, although I can't say how much each query will cost. Under $0.01, from my experience.

ChatGPT itself was heavily involved in writing this plugin.
